Inspired by Dave Plummer's YouTube video on un-improving Notepad (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmBd39OwvWg), I decided to try using Copilot to create a better Windows magnifier.  I hate the way the new built in magnifier app zooms the entire screen... I want to still be able to work, but sometimes I just get really curious about what pixels exist in the corner of a capital "T" (for example).

I included all the prompts I used as I went in the file Prompts.txt (even the embarrasing four tries I got stuck on because of user error with my own UI!), as well as the few minor code changes I made.

I called it SeeGreen because zooming in helps you see... and my last name is Green. :)
